### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**scdawson789/scdawson789** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an MS in Data Analytics with Data Science cluster (electives)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently gaining more expertise with python

This application was createda as part of my Data Driven Dev with python class.  My focus was really to allow the user to search the database to
find their own story from the data and to have a visualization returned along with the data set.
I will continue to update the app to improve visual aesthetics.
